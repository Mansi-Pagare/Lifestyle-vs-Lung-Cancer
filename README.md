# Lifestyle-vs-Lung-Cancer
Statistical analysis and exploratory data investigation of lung cancer risk factors. This project examines the impact of lifestyle choices on lung cancer levels using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis includes hypothesis testing, data visualization, and logistic regression models to explore the relationship between variables such as smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and passive smoking with the severity of lung cancer.
In this project, a detailed statistical analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between various lifestyle factors and the risk of developing lung cancer. Using R and RStudio, the data was processed and visualized to identify significant patterns and correlations. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of statistical methods to assess the impact of factors such as smoking, diet, and physical activity on lung cancer risk. The findings provide insights into how these factors may contribute to lung cancer, with a focus on interpreting the results through graphs and statistical summaries presented in an R Markdown file.
